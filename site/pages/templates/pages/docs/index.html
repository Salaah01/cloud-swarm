    <h2 class="heading-2">1. Create Account</h2>
    <p>
      The very first step you need to take in order to get started is to
      <a href="{% url 'register' %}" target="_blank">create an account</a>.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2 class="heading-2">2. Register a Site</h2>
    <p>
      Add a new site to your account by clicking the "Add Site" button on the
      <a href="{% url 'sites-dashboard' %}" target="_blank">Sites</a> page.
    </p>
    <p>
      Complete the form entering the details requested and submit.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2 class="heading-2">3. Update DNS Settings</h2>
    <p>
      Once you have completed the site registration form, you will be directed
      to your site dashboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below is an example of what we should see assuming we had registered
      Bluish Pink in the previous step:
    </p>
    <img src="{% static 'pages/img/docs/unverified-site.jpg' %}" alt="Unverified Site" class="img-fluid border px-4 py-3">
    <p>
      Couple things to notice:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <ol>1. Site is unverified</ol>
      <ol>2. A random set of characters</ol>
      <ol>3. A verify site button</ol>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Our site is intended to be used for testing purposes only. However, we do
      see the potential for abuse. Therefore, we require that you verify your
      site before you are able to start using our services.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to verify your site, you will need to update your DNS settings and
      create a TXT record with the key provided by us (point 2).
    </p>
    <p>
      Using the example above, we would create a TXT record with the following
      settings:
    </p>
    <div class="border px-4 py-3">
      <p><strong>Type:</strong> TXT</p>
      <p><strong>Hostname:</strong> @</p>
      <p><strong>Value:</strong> cloud-swarm-verification=4c972f6b7b8d47255bb078a6230d0edf5dd25b1e757eacdd31b7370f3e53b3a6</p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Once you have created the TXT record, you will be able to verify your site
      by clicking the "Verify Site" button.
    </p>
    <p>Once verified, your site page should look like the example below:</p>
    <img src="{% static 'pages/img/docs/verified-site.jpg' %}" alt="Unverified Site" class="img-fluid border px-4 py-3">
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2 class="heading-2">4. Run Benchmark</h2>
    <p>
      Click on the "New Benchmark" button to start a new benchmark. You will be
      directed to a page where you can select your benchmark parameters.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Number of Server:</strong> The number of servers you want to run
      the benchmark on. Each server would have its own IP address. This is an
      important feature we provide as some servers can throttle requests
      coming from the same IP address.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Number of Requests:</strong> The number of requests you want to
      send to from each server.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you are ready, click on "Submit" and you will be directed back to
      the site page from where you will be able to monitor the benchmark.
    </p>
  </div>
